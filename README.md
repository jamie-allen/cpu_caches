# Taxonomy of Scala
This is a repo for my work on the presentation I will be giving at StrangeLoop 2012.  To see the rendered presentation (sans images), go to [this page](https://github.com/jamie-allen/taxonomy-of-scala/blob/master/preso/presentation.md).

A ShowOff presentation based on [Brian Clapper's](https://github.com/scala-phase/scala-orms/tree/master/ScalaQuery) presentation template.

For more information about ShowOff, see [Shawn Chacon's page](https://github.com/schacon/showoff).

## Commands:
* "rake css" to generate CSS from SASS
* "rake run" to serve pages (or you can use "showoff serve")

## Requires the following Ruby gems:
* rubygems
* showoff
* sass
* slidedown
* albino

## Optional Ruby gems:
* mongrel (to serve pages with Mongrel instead of WebRick)
* pdfkit (to generate PDF of presentation)
